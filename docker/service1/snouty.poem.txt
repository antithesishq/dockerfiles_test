In the heart of the forest, where tall trees sway,
Lives Snouty, our mascot, in a unique way.
With a long, slender snout, like a flexible hose,
He roams through the jungle where lush foliage grows.

His coat is a tapestry of earthy hues,
Camouflaged perfectly amid leaves and dews.
A master of stealth in the moon's gentle glow,
He's the symbol of grace in the jungle's ebb and flow.

Oh, Snouty, you anteater, with grace in your stride,
In your quiet pursuit, through the foliage you glide.
With claws that are nimble, yet sharp as can be,
You capture your meals, from ants to termites, with glee.

Your snout is your tool, an exquisite design,
To seek out your prey, to dine and recline.
You're a symbol of patience, in a world that's so fast,
A reminder to savor each moment, to make it last.

In your eyes, there's a wisdom that time cannot erase,
A connection to nature, a serene embrace.
As our mascot, you teach us the lessons we need,
To cherish the Earth and her wonders, indeed.

Snouty, dear Snouty, our mascot so grand,
In your image, we stand, hand in hand.
To protect and preserve, to cherish and care,
For the beauty of nature, so wild and so rare.

So, here's to you, Snouty, our emblem so true,
With your snout reaching out, we salute and renew,
Our commitment to nature, our Earth, and her kin,
For with you as our guide, we're bound to win.

- Snouty
